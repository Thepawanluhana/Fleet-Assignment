The current application is build just for completing the task. Given more time I could make the following updates:

1. Write CSS in a separate file instead of inline styling.
2. Create re-usable components in react instead of just one main component.
3. Use Redux for API calls.
4. Create routes for the APIs.
5. Create separate files for DB connection, routes and server file.
6. Update the schema created for the collection.
7. Pass the parameters in the API call instead of simple GET request.
